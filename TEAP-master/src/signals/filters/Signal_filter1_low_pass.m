% 
%> @param Signal: the signal to filter (will use the .raw component). Not a bulk sig. !
%> @param cutOffFreq: the cutOff frequency of the filter
% 
%> @retval Signal: the low-passed-signal

%Take the sampling frequency of the signal
Fs = Signal__get_samprate(Signal);

%The normalized cutOff freq
Wn = (2/Fs)*cutOffFreq;

%Make the filter
b = fir1(20, Wn, 'low', kaiser(21, 3));

rawSignal = Signal__get_raw(Signal);

newRaw = filter(b, 1, rawSignal);

Signal = Signal__set_raw(Signal, newRaw);

%Indicate that the signal has been filtered
Signal = Signal__set_preproc_lowpass(Signal);
