%> @brief Computes Skin respiration features
%> @param  EEGsignal: the respiration  signal.
%> @param  varargin: you can choose which features to extract (see featureSelector)
%>            the list of available features is:
%>               - SP_delta:power spectral power for delta band <4Hz
%>               - SP_theta: power spectral power for theta band [4,8[ Hz
%>               - SP_slowAlpha: power spectral power for slow alpha band [8,[10 Hz
%>               - SP_alpha: power spectral power for alpha band [8,12[ Hz
%>               - SP_beta: power spectral power for beta band [12,30[ Hz
%>               - SP_gamma: power spectral power for gamma band >30Hz
% 
%> @retval  EEG_feats: list of features values
%> @retval  EEG_feats_names: names of the computed features (it is good pratice to
%>                   check this vector since the order of requested features
%>                   can be different than the requested one)
%>               the  features are per electode and therefore  1xN (N= number of electrodes)
%>               and the final output is a 2dimensional array whose size is N_features x N_electrodes
