%> @brief ECG_aqn_variable gets an ECG signal from a variable
%> @attention USAGE:
%> If you've got the signal from the 2 electrodes, you must call the function
%> like that:
%>  @c ECG_aqn_variable(electrode1, electrode2, sampRate);
%> If, however, the difference was already calculated by your device, you can
%> call the function that way:
%>  @c ECG_aqn_variable(electrodesDiff, sampRate);
% 
%> @param   ECG [1xN]:  the ECG signal
%> @param   ECG2 [1xN]: the other pair ECG signal (optional if difference already calc.)
%> @param   sampRate [1x1]: the sampling rate, in Hz
% 
%> @retval   Signal: An ECG TEAP signal
