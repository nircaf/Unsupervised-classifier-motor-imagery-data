%> @file Signal__get_window_frames.m
%> @brief Takes a portion of a signal between startT and endT frames. NB: that the
%> child signal will memorize the offset to its father (the first-one, non recursive)
%> start: useful if you want to plot the signal with logical times.
%> If you want to specify seconds instead of frames, you should use @c Signal__get_window()
%>
%> @attention SEE ALSO:
%>  - Signal__get_window
%>  - Signal__get_offset
%
%> @param  Signal: the signal you want to take a portion of.
%> @param startT: the start time (frames)
%> @param endT: the end time (frames)
% 
%> @retval Child: the cut signal
