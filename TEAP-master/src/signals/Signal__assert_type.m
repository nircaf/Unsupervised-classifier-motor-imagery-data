%> @file Signal__assert_type.m
%> @brief Checks that the signal given on the input is of the type nameWanted
%> This function is mainly used by @b SSS_assert_type(Sig), with params @b Sig and @b SSS.
% 
%> @attention NOTA BENE: in the case that Signal is a BULK signal, this function will
%> return, if it exists, the wanted signal, or fail if it doesn't.
% 
%> @param  Signal: The signal you want to make sure of the type (can be a BULK signal,
%>          in that case, will take the component.
%> Bulk: if the input is a bulk than the bulk is also returned to keep a
%>        backup of it. An empty vector is returned if the input is not a Bulk
%> @param  nameWanted: the type the signal must be of (ex: 'GSR').
% 
%> @retval  Signal: the signal. Can be the same as the input if single signal, or the
%>          signal from the bulk if the input signal is a bulk one.
