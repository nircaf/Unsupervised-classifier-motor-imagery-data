%> @file EMG_aqn_variable.m
%> @brief EMG_aqn_variable gets an EMG signal from a variable
%> @b USAGE:
%> If you've got the signal from the 2 electrodes, you must call the function
%> like that:
%> @code
%>  EMG_aqn_variable(electrode1, electrode2, sampRate);
%> @endcode
%> If, however, the difference was already calculated by your device, you can
%> call the function that way:
%> @code
%>  EMG_aqn_variable(electrodesDiff, sampRate);
%> @endcode
%
%> @param   EMG [1xN]:  the EMG signal
%> @param   EMG2 [1xN]: the other pair EMG signal (optional if difference already calc.)
%> @param   sampRate [1x1]: the sampling rate, in Hz
% 
%> @retval Signal An EMG TEAP signal
