Coding Style
++++++++++++
The best way to see the actual coding style is to see how the src/signals/DMY dummy
signal library is done. Anyway these are the main guidelines:

Indentation:
------------
The indentation should be made with the use of TABs to adjust to the indentation
level, then with spaces. Ex:
	if(this_long_function(
	    will_overflow)
		Bar
	end

Spaces:
-------
Obviously, there should be no trailing spaces. Also, when calling a function
or in arrays, there should be a single space after the comma (like in the
English language ;) )

Variable naming:
----------------
Variables should be camelCased except for signal structures that should have
an uppercase character, then all the rest in lowercase.

Function naming:
----------------
Functions should be named following this scheme:
SSS_rrr_eee
Where SSS is the signal name (eg. EEG, ECG, etc.),
rrr is the role of the function (eg. aqn=acquisition, get, wrk=work, ect.),
eee are the extra attributes (eg. file, realtime, etc.).

Here are some examples:
ECG_aqn_file(filename), ECG_aqn_realtime(), ECG_feat_IBIMean(Signal), â€¦
